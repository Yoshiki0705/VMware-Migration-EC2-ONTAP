"""D1 must agree with markdown-it on whether a `**` renders.

The expected values in `fixtures/ai_style_strong.json` were produced by markdown-it itself, through
the Hub's `scripts/regenerate_ai_style_fixtures.mjs`. That Node regenerator is NOT ported into this
spoke: the JSON here is read-only copied data, and this test reads it only, so the gate stays
stdlib-only and the rule file stays copyable.

The case that motivated the rule reads correctly in the source and does not render:
`は**「X」**で` leaves four literal asterisks, because a `**` between a Japanese particle and a
bracket is neither left- nor right-flanking. Nobody notices it in an editor, which is why it is
checked against a renderer rather than against intuition.
